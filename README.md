This is a multiplayer Snake game I made for University of Utah course CS 3500 alongside my partner Shem Snow. I made a Server that relies on TCP ports to send and receive information. I made Snake Client using Maui GUI to display game information that is received from the server on regular frame ticks. This project will not run by just pulling and hitting run. Additional setup to allow Maui, the server, and the client to run is necessary. But no additional coding is necessary.
